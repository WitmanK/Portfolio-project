      <h1>Spain</h1>
      <p class="country-top-paragraphs">
        In January 2023 we have travelled to a small town in the North of Spain.
        We stayed in Gijón for 4 nights, and the total cost for the flights and
        accomondation was £55pp.

            <strong>Gijón Surf Hostel</strong>
            <br />

            One of the reasons why the trip was so cheap, was because we decided
            to not spend much on the accomodation. We stayed in a surf hostel in
            a small surfing town, Gijón. The facilities were very clean, staff
            extremely friendly and overall it was a positive stay. The hostel
            offers trips/ equipment for surfing, paddle boarding and more. The
            total cost per person/ 4 night was £40.

            <strong>Jesters of Arenillas</strong>
            <br />
            The time spent in Asturias was interesting to say the least. Without
            any preparation we have booked flight tickets in January (no wonder
            why they were so cheap!). Our first day in Asturias we decided to
            visit Jesters of Arenillas. Beautiful natural formation of clifs
            that with the incoming waves, the holes in the cliff would explode
            with sea water. Pleasent views with a small adrenaline rush.

            <strong>Night life</strong>
            <br />

            During winter times in north of Spain, ther is not much nightlife.
            You can't find any bars that are open before 5PM, and you're limited
            with drinks selection. There is a lot of beauty in the simplicity of
            this. We have spent much time in local bar/ restaurants, speaking to
            locals and of course, polish up on our Spanish (as there is a small
            percentage of people that speak English in the region).
